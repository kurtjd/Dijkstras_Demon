# Dijkstra's Demon
A quick demo I threw together to demonstrate Dijkstra's algorithm in a
pathfinding context for my Discrete Math class. Setup some obstacles and watch
Dijkstra's Demon navigate his way toward his buddy Discrete Math Marshmallow!

## Requirements
* Python 3+
* All requirements in requirements.txt

## Installation
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Run
```python demon.py```

## Instructions
* Click a grid cell to place a wall (click again to remove wall)
* After placing walls, press Enter
* Watch as Dijkstra's Demon navigates his way toward his buddy Discrete Math Marshmallow!
* Restart script to play again
